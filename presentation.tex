  \frametitle{LAMP Stack\footnote{LEMP stack also existed, nginx in place of apache}}

  \begin{itemize}
    \pausefn\item Most servers would have used Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP
    \pausefn\item Installed as system packages
    \pausefn\item On distros like Ubuntu, you don't get updated packages, opposite with Arch
    \pausefn\item Difficult to pin the system to, say Python 3.5
    \pausefn\item You'd have to add the rewrite rules to your Apache config (God help you if your guide was written for nginx)
  \end{itemize}

  \frametitle{What that meant for your average Sysadmin}

  \begin{itemize}
    \pausefn\item Installation for open-source packages are a pain (like prestashop)
    \pausefn\item Server Migration was slow.
    \pausefn\item Making services run on boot wasn't easy, especially:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item If the server program isn't something straightforward (like PHP) you'll probably have to write your own scripts
      \item Before the widespread adoption of systemd
    \end{itemize}
